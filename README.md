# Web Application Security Assessment

This project involves performing web application pentesting on OWASP Juice Shop, an e-commerce type web application purposely built with vulnerabilities for educational purposes. The objective is to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities ethically. The resulting report will highlight discovered vulnerabilities and their impact. 

It's worth noting that OWASP Juice Shop contains numerous other vulnerabilities beyond those explored in this project.
